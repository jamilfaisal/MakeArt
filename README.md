# MakeArt
A simple drawing tool made with JavaFX!

This is the first JavaFX I ever developed.
Combines different scenes and stages to make a toolbar and a drawing board.
Only possible to add shapes and modify them based on different parameters (radius, size, color, etc...)
Possible to save your drawing as an image file.

Updates Needed:
- Must refactor code into several java files...
